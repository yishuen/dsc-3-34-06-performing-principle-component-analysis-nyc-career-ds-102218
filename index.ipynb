In the case of the transformation using both eigenvectors, we have simply altered the data so that it is in terms of those eigenvectors instead of\n",
    "the usual axes. But the single-eigenvector decomposition has removed the contribution due to the smaller eigenvector and left us with data that is only in terms of the other."
